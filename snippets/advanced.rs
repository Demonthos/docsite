/// Dioxus accepts fragments, iterators, conditionals, listeners, matching, f_string iterpolation and more. Anything that can
/// be coerced into an iterator of VNodes can be used in the macro bodies. By default, `rsx!` is Lazy, meaning it won't allocate
/// until "rendered" with a `render` call.
///
/// Elements are created with a dedicated memory allocator that intelligently reuses memory between renders. A component
/// at "steady-state" performs zero global allocations, making rendering extremely fast and memory efficient.
