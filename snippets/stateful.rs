/// # A Stateful Component

/// Dioxus components use hooks to store state between renders.
/// The `use_state` hooks make it easy to update state from
/// event listeners attached to elements in the component.
/// Whenever the state is modified, the component will be re-rendered.
///
/// Thanks to Rust's ownership rules, it's impossible to misuse the `use_state` hook.
